          <div>
            <p>My name is Dylan Hearn and I am an author. It has taken me a while to admit this. I started this blog because I wanted to write, so I wrote about many different things, but over time the blog has become focussed on the act of writing and self-publishing. This doesn’t mean I’m anti- traditional publishing but I have little experience of it.</p>
            <p>I rarely, if ever, talk about how to write, but I often talk about everything around it. Luckily, a few people have found my thoughts valuable (I ignore the ones that don’t).</p>
